Welcome to Lab #4 (April, 2020)

Basically, you will replace all of
my files with your own work.

Please remember to:

 1. Activate GiT,  with (VCS->Enable Version Control).
 2. Commit your work to Git, with the green "check".
 3. As you add new files, include them in your "git"
     (you will be queried).
 4. Anytime you want to "push" back to GitLab:
     a.  "commit" to your Git
     b.  "Push" back to GitLab

If you have questions about this
lab, including Git and GitLab,
you should contact me.
